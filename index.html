            <h1>Esther Khair</h1>
            <p> Hello! I'm Esther Khair, a passionate and driven student 
                pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and 
                Psychology at Tufts University. My academic journey is enriched 
                with a diverse range of courses, from Data Structures and Web 
                Programming to Social Psychology and Quantum Computer Science, 
                reflecting my multidisciplinary interests and commitment to comprehensive learning.
                <br>
                Currently, I work as a Web Programming Course Assistant at Tufts 
                University, where I grade assignments, provide constructive feedback, 
                and assist students during office hours. My hands-on experience includes 
                leading a team to develop an API-supported web application, The 
                Notebook, which enhances in-class note-taking.
                <br>
                In addition to my technical skills in C/C++, Python, HTML, CSS, 
                and JavaScript, I am proficient in English, Arabic, and German. 
                My involvement in the Women in Computer Science and Arab Student
                 Association at Tufts underscores my dedication to community and 
                 leadership.
                <br>
                Beyond academia, I have diverse work experiences, from organizing
                 rush hour stations at Hodgdon Food on the Run to engaging with 
                 international tourists at a souvenir store in Palestine. As a Science
                  Fair Coordinator at the Evangelical Lutheran School, I showcased my 
                  organizational and presentation skills by coordinating experiments 
                  and explaining origional and colaboratibve projects to guests.
                <br>
                Driven by curiosity and a love for learning, I am eager to contribute 
                to innovative projects and make a meaningful impact in the field of technology.</p>
